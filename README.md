# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

- **Competitive Analysis** of leading competitors found strengths and **oppurtunities for innovation** in key areas:<br>
_Persistant Users_: Users need a way to **track their progress**!<br>
_Finding Others_: Players **learn best** while practicing against a **real opponent**!<br>
_Ability to help others_: Users Like sharing! Give them a way to **teach others**!
- **Heuristic Evalutation** of a competitor found that having premade drills onboards users easily, and allows users to **start at their own skill level**
- New Personas and scenarios reflect insights of users experience needs:
  - Social networking & skill training 
  - **Easier discovery** of other players and locations
  - **Exclusion of pool sharks** from the platform

- Sketches and diagrams illustrate initial concepts:
  - **Intuitive navigation** to quickly navigate related content
  - Premade Drills to **quickly onboard users**
  - **Statistic tracking** to evaluate users on progress

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

The game of pool is a very popular pastime but it can be very difficult to
improve and learn new skills. Whether a new player or an expert, Billiards Trainer aims to help
players advance their abilities by providing helpful drills, tracking their stats, and providing
feedback to take them to the next level.

**Designing Wireframes**: We created a profile page. We still need to create the other pages such
as the login and home pages.

**Cognitive Walkthroughs**: Showed that users wanted a better visualization of their stats. This
could be done by adding new statistics such as the time of their games and the opponent that
they faced. Users also found it difficult to log into their profile since the wireframe had the user
starting from the point of already being logged in.

**User Feedback**: We learned that users prefer a phone sized aspect ratio. We also learned that
users liked the idea of creating their own drills and preferred the style of “thought posting” for
communicating with other users. Users also conveyed ideas of an “elo” system that would make
it so that players could find matches based on similar rank, games won, or experience in
general.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**<br><br>
BilliardsTrainer aims to simplify the learning process for billiards enthusiasts, catering to beginners, casual players, and experts. The focus of this phase was on developing a prototype website and conducting a usability study to assess its effectiveness.
- Four out of five potential users participated. While the **sample size fell below the ideal**, valuable insights were gathered.
- 75% of participants had experienced learning a new sport, all had recent pool experience, and **75% preferred playing at a bar**.
- Users **navigated the prototype well, with minor issues in the drill list function.** All completed tasks successfully, but the search bar for news articles posed a challenge.
- Users found the website **visually unappealing but practical.** Feedback included neutral to negative opinions on the prototype's limitations.
- In the future users would like
  - **Improve website aesthetics** and interactivity.
  - **Incorporate video content,** especially for billiards drills.
  - Enhance **profile page customization.**
BilliardsTrainer has a solid foundation but requires refinement to enhance user appeal and engagement, with attention to visual elements and additional features to fulfill user expectations.
