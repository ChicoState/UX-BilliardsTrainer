# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods
For this phase, our team conducted a Cognitive Walkthrough and obtained Informal Feedback to gain new insights for our wireframes and our design. First, we conducted a **Cognitive Walkthrough** which evaluates our design and wireframes by checking if the user knows what to do at every step of our wireframe and if not, then they had to document what steps did they get stuck on or get confused and explain why. Hence, we started by having two users read through several scenarios we had given them and then they had to look at the wireframes and evaluate whether each step made sense and document their progress. Our end goal was to determine whether our wireframes was user-friendly and was easy for the user to reach the end goal. 

Our last method was extracting **Informal Feedback** from the Software Engineering lab, since we wanted to know suggestions they had about our design. So, we asked them the following questions:
1. What aspect ratio would the class prefer for our app: a laptop or a phone aspect ratio?
2. Would the class like an option to create their own drills or use templates to create their own Billiard practice drills?
3. What type of communication would the class like to use: 

	A. Would they prefer a form style communication (i.e. Users can make posts and people can respond to them and make their comments)

	B. Would they prefer a real-time forum style communication (i.e. Users can chat with each other in real-time so messages are not saved, but they communicate with other people live)

	C. Or would users prefer a DM style communication?
## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!
