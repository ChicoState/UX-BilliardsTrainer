# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Billiards is an easy game to learn, but a hard game to master. Billiards trainer aims to lessen this gap by providing a smooth learning curve to guide players. In this phase we focused primarily on ensuring a smooth user experience and refining our ideas into a concrete wireframe.  

## Methods
For this phase, our team conducted a Cognitive Walkthrough and obtained Informal Feedback to gain new insights for our wireframes and our design. First, we conducted a **Cognitive Walkthrough** which evaluates our design and wireframes by checking if the user knows what to do at every step of our wireframe and if not, then they had to document what steps did they get stuck on or get confused and explain why. Hence, we started by having two users read through several scenarios we had given them and then they had to look at the wireframes and evaluate whether each step made sense and document their progress. Our end goal was to determine whether our wireframes was user-friendly and was easy for the user to reach the end goal. 

Our last method was extracting **Informal Feedback** from the Software Engineering lab, since we wanted to know suggestions they had about our design. So, we asked them the following questions:
1. What aspect ratio would the class prefer for our app: a laptop or a phone aspect ratio?
2. Would the class like an option to create their own drills or use templates to create their own Billiard practice drills?
3. What type of communication would the class like to use:  
	A. Would they prefer a form style communication (i.e. Users can make posts and people can respond to them and make their comments)  
	B. Would they prefer a real-time forum style communication (i.e. Users can chat with each other in real-time so messages are not saved, but they communicate with other people live)  
	C. Or would users prefer a DM style communication?
## Findings

After careful analysis of the results of the cognitive walkthrough given by two exterior designers, we have found that users would like to:

* Have a more clear way to login
* View progress over time.
* Have dates associated with matches and drill completion
* Further analysis of matches to deduce matters like was it Fair matchmaking

As for the questions we asked developers working on other projects to receive Informal feedback, we found that they:

* Preferred the aspect ratio of a phone.
* Liked the idea of user drill creation
* Thought forum board posting would be a good form of communication between players and the community
* Additionally gave ideas about an ‘elo’ system, so players are evenly matched based on player rank, games won, and experience playing. 

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
Despite our best efforts in trying to have an unbiased and error-free review of our walkthrough, we have some major caveats such as getting Cognitive Walkthrough from a limited pool of people who did not fit our Personas. Also, since our Wireframe had only 2 frames at the time of the walkthrough, we had a limited congitive walkthrough, so we could not get more feedback for our other pages.
