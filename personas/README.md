**Garret Miller
23 Year Old 
Undergrad in Kinesiology**

Garret enjoys being a student, but enjoys having free-time even more. He is excited to become a professional physical trainer. He is extroverted and spends most of his weekends with his friend group at the local bar. They usually buy a few games of pool.

Garret is competitive even if it is a friendly game. Outside of these meetups he doesn’t have much time to practice so he would like small drills to hone common shots.

**Jimmy Hill
31 Years Old
Professional Pool Shark**

Jimmy is a pool shark and part time bouncer. He spends most of his time going through different bars and pool clubs taking advantage of new players and their inexperienced betting. He is very cocky and doesn’t have any friends but he doesn’t care. Jimmy has been in a bit of a slump and has seemingly lost his touch at pool. This has led to him seeking out new ways to improve his skills.

#Scenarios:
Title: Hector Practices
	Hector currently goes to the pool hall. He checks out a table and plays for a few hours. He generally practices by just playing standard billiards games, the only one he knows how to play, with one player. Similar to playing chess by yourself. This practice does well for a warm up, but without competition or any new drills Hector feels stagnant. Most people come to the pool hall as a group and are typically younger so Hector feels uncomfortable asking to join, leaving him to feel isolated. 

Title: Upcoming tournament 
Garret notices a poster for an upcoming tournament with a grand prize of $300. The other players around him are experienced players with years under their belt and they know techniques like banking and soft shots, techniques that he did not even know existed. Since the tournament is 2 weeks away, wants to learn these techniques as soon as possible, if he wants to stand a chance of winning the whole thing. 

Title: Broke Billiards
Jimmy has been visiting the bars more frequently so that he can win enough bets to make a dent in his crippling debt. He has a table at home and has been consistently practicing each day but has hit a wall with improvement. The players around him have been getting much better and he is worried he will fall behind the competition.
