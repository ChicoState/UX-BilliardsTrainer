Garret Miller
23 Year Old 
Undergrad in Kinesiology

Garret enjoys being a student, but enjoys having free-time even more. He is excited to become a professional physical trainer. He is extroverted and spends most of his weekends with his friend group at the local bar. They usually buy a few games of pool.

Garret is competitive even if it is a friendly game. Outside of these meetups he doesn’t have much time to practice so he would like small drills to hone common shots.

Jimmy Hill
31 Years Old
Professional Pool Shark

Jimmy is a pool shark and part time bouncer. He spends most of his time going through different bars and pool clubs taking advantage of new players and their inexperienced betting. He is very cocky and doesn’t have any friends but he doesn’t care. Jimmy has been in a bit of a slump and has seemingly lost his touch at pool. This has led to him seeking out new ways to improve his skills.
