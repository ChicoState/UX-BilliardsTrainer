# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction
BilliardsTrainer serves to make learning Billiards easy for beginners, casual players, and even experts. Through our list of drills, stats, and local news, users immerse themselves into the culture of Billiards until they can become a regular! In this phase, we focused primarily on creating a Prototype, which is the closest representation of the end product, our website. After making the prototype, we conducted a usability test where test users could try to solve tasks we assigned them and get their feedback to find issues and improve ou design. The Results were recorded in a [data sheet](assets/UXTeamData.pdf)

## Methods

### Usability Study
Our team facilitated an usability study (n = 4) on the Billiards Trainer prototype. We recruited from the sample of CSCI 431W Usability Engineering due  to time and budget constraints. We facilitated four appointments with the fifth being a no-show. We realize that the ideal lowest sample number should be five. 
#### Introduction
The test was executed as the following, after sitting down the subjects are introduced to the [Informed Consent](assets/INFORMEDCONSENTFORM.pdf) form which is read to them as they have their own copy to follow along. The informed consent explains the time requirement, risks, and the lack of incentive and that it is a test of the product not of the user. Once signed the moderator then explains what the test will entail, including the use of the “think-aloud-protocol” as described on the [Usability Test Plan Protocol](assets/BilliardsTestPlanProtocol.pdf)
#### Background
The moderator then proceeds to the Background Questions and takes note of important information. The 1st question is asked to attempt to understand the common methods how a subject would approach a sport to gauge overall viability to using a website to  assist in training. The 2nd question is related to interest in Billiards and is used to understand why or how people were first introduced to Billiards. The 3rd question is asked to assess how often the subject plays Billiards, a time closer to the present might indicate frequent or habitual playing. The last background question is related to the location of the billiards table they prefer to play at. This can help decide the form factor of the website. 
#### Tasks
The first task is presented to the subject along with the prototype, and is a test of how mental models of users are compared to the model used by the website. The moderator takes into account the process the user takes and checks boxes for major milestones in performing the task.

The Second task covers the users ability to use our drills list function, and find a beginners course. This is to test if the navigation of the website matches their mental model. The user is also asked how they would go about executing the drill to gauge whether the drill format is preferred to videos or other helpful learning alternatives.

The third task is to navigate to the news article and is a test of how mental models of users are compared to the model used by the website. The moderator takes into account the process the user takes and checks boxes for major milestones in performing the task.
#### Wrap-Up
The wrap up questions are asked to gather more information about the general overall feeling of the website, in order to gauge user appeal. We asked about general likes dislike, the overall look and the way in particular the Drills List Page is laid out.  We also queried the user about similar products and additional features that may have interest. The users are then asked for any last comments, and are thanked for their participation. 


## Findings

### Usability Study
We had availability for six appointments for the usability test. We ended up having five potential users sign up to take the test but only four showed up. This put us below the ideal lowest sample number which was five user tests.

### Introduction

Each of the four user participants either read the consent form or had it read to them. After each user provided us with signatures, we proceeded to give a brief breakdown of the nature of the tasks that they were to carry out. 

### Background

We found that 75% of our participants have had notable experience with learning a new sport in the past. Every participant had experience with playing pool as well, with every user having played within the last six months. 75% of users also said they would prefer to play at a bar while 25% said they would prefer to play pool in their own home. 

### Tasks

Each user was able to successfully complete task one without any major challenges. Each user found it relatively easy to first login and then navigate to the profile page. For task two, 75% of users were able to successfully complete the task. One user found a bug in the system where after sorting the drills page by difficulty, they were unable to click on the drill of their choice. For the final task, every user was able to complete the task and navigate to the news section. From there, each user was able to find the Christmas article. While the task was successfully completed, not a single user was able to navigate to the article by using the search bar to find the specific author by their credentials. This was another smaller task that we were hoping that the user would be able to utilize to make their search easier.

### Wrap-Up

For the first initial thoughts, a majority of users found the website to be visually unapppealing. However they all agreed that the website looked rather practical. 

For likes/dislikes, one user was neutral while another thought that the prototype was too limited in regards to the player and about sections. Another user disliked the drills page as a result of the bug that blocked the completion of a task. Half of the users in total did list the drills page as a noticeable like. 

When asking for more thoughts on the drills page, half of the users liked the ability to sort the drills. Half of the users also liked the way that the difficulty was displayed for each drill. 

When asked if any of the users had used a product like Billiards Trainer, they all answered no. 

For the final question of what additional features we should add, half of users wanted videos or clips of billiards drills to be included in the drills section. The other recommendations were to improve the visual design and add a logout button and system where the user is asked about their experience with billiards before they log out. 

## Conclusions

The first take away we had was that the website functioned as we intended, with only one bug occurring on one task. While the core functions of our website were pretty reliable, we got a lot of feedback on how to improve our site visually as well as feedback on adding some features that would make it much easier to use our website. At the time of our test, the search bar and filters were not fully usable and this was pointed out to us multiple times throughout the tests. Overall, the biggest thing we need to work on is making the website much more interactive. Adding clips of drills and other billiards related clips would make the website much more appealing and captivating compared to how it is now. As of now, it is simply information in text without any way to make it interesting. Also, it would be very useful to add more customization to the profile page to make it feel more inviting. There were many other small critiques we received that would be important to add later on. Basics such as a log out button would be very important and increasing the size of the navigation bar at the top. Overall though for what our goal with the website is, our foundation is a great starting point in terms of practicality. 


## Caveats
The biggest caveat is that the people we have gotten to do our user tests were from our class. Since our group requires a specific pool of participants instead of a general group of people, we did not get the direct feedback we would have liked for our app from people knowledgeable in our topic.

Furthermore, we only got four people to participate in our user study instead of 5, which makes it harder to analyze and draw conclusions from a limited pool of people.
