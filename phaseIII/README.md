# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction
BilliardsTrainer serves to make learning Billiards easy for beginners, casual players, and even experts. Through our list of drills, stats, and local news, users immerse themselves into the culture of Billiards until they can become a regular! In this phase, we focused primarily on creating a Prototype, which is the closest representation of the end product, our website. After making the prototype, we conducted a usability test where test users could try to solve tasks we assigned them and get their feedback to find issues and improve ou design.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
The biggest caveat is that the people we have gotten to do our user tests were from our class. Since our group requires a specific pool of participants instead of a general group of people, we did not get the direct feedback we would have liked for our app from people knowledgeable in our topic.

Furthermore, we only got four people to participate in our user study instead of 5, which makes it harder to analyze and draw conclusions from a limited pool of people.
