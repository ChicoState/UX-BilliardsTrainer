# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

It can be hard to learn a sport for the first time, especially billiards. Hence, users can now learn how to play billiards by playing drills and videos. Furthermore, they can track their stats using by playing against real opponents and gain experience. 

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
We did not take actual feedback from users so we made assumptions about who our users might and thus we could not do any testing. 
<br/><br/>
Furthermore, we do not have a main competitor as our competitors are physical trainers and a static website, but we are website that allow users to create drills and improve their stats.
