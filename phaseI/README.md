# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

It can be hard to learn a sport for the first time, especially billiards. Hence, users can now learn how to play billiards by playing drills and videos. Furthermore, they can track their stats by playing against real opponents and gain experience as they play. 

## Methods

### Competitive Analysis
One method of research we participated in is Competitive analysis. We gathered a small list of about four potential competitors. We determined this list by the hypothetical likelihood of what someone would search when curious about self-teaching billiards. The list consisted of Youtube, as it is a expansive resource that covers a multitude of topics with many different perspectives, DrillRoom, an app that is only available on IOS appstore and was one of the top results, Basic Billiards, a website which was amongst the top results and specializes in tutorials from beginner to advanced, and Physical Training Aids from OzoneBilliards, which was chosen because of the more hands on approach can be appealing. We categorized the competitors on their strengths and weaknesses, the quality of their content, the price of the user, and the availability of the platform.<br>

### Heuristic Evaluation
  Another method of research we used was Heuristic Evaluation. Using the data from our competitive analysis we determined that the biggest competitor is Billiards Trainer considering we are most closely related in terms of our project. We executed the heuristic evaluation across 10 categories, visibility of system status, Match between system and the real world, User Control and freedom, consistency and standards, error prevention, recognition rather than recall, flexibility & efficiency of use, Aesthetic and minimalist design, help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors, and help and documentation. These categories chosen were based off of the “10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" by the Nielsen Norman Group. Each category was rated on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being non-existent and 10 being excellent. Notes were added to justify each rating given.


## Findings
Competitive Analysis

Youtube was a strong competitor because of the amount of content that the user could learn from. There are videos covering every aspect of pool from beginner learning to advanced learning. Youtube is also available on every device for free, making it very accessible. However, a downside of youtube is that it could potentially teach bad technique because of the lack of any regulation. It also has no way of tracking your skill improvement.

Drill Room was a very interesting competitor because of its ability to interact with the user through AI. It used this AI to tell the user which shot to take based on the options on the pool table. This app requires a lot of setup though, including a tripod and good lighting. It also requires a subscription service to access more drills and only works on IOS. While this app has a lot of potential, it seems like a hassle to use. We were also unable to test the quality of the AI because of our limited budget.

Basic Billiards was a much simpler option. It’s a free website that teaches courses through articles and short animations. The site provides excellent and reliable information on all aspects of pool and is available on all devices. The only problem is that it lacks any form of interactivity.

The last competitor was physical training aids. This option provides the best interactivity but is much more expensive than the other options. Physical trainers can account for factors that AI is unable to, such as bad bumpers on a table or if the table is lopsided. Quality is also dependent on how good the trainer is. We were unable to test this option out because of our limited budget.


Heuristic Analysis

1. Visibility of System Status: 7/10 
The site has a lot of short animations that are easy to follow along with. The play and replay buttons are both very obvious and don’t require much thought to use. The only problem is when pausing videos, there is no feedback that you paused the video. 

2. Match between system and the real world: 7/10 
The site does a great job of defining the necessary terms for pool. At the start of each course, the site describes a scenario and explains how you should use the cue ball and table to make your shot. This is how the site defines each term such as bank shots or spinning. Instead of just defining the shot, a realistic situation is used instead which is very helpful.The only problem with this is that each course is labeled by a pool term, which the user might not understand before the lesson.

3. User control and freedom: 8/10
At all times, the site has headlines for courses, blog, about, and contact us. Most importantly, the site has it’s name at the top right which when clicked on sends you back to the main screen. It’s not exceptional but works as it should. 

4. Consistency and standards:10/10 
There is no ambiguity with any of the wording on the site. Everything makes sense as it should.  

5. Error prevention: 10/10 
The site does not leave any room for errors to happen since the layout is so simplistic. 

6. Recognition rather than recall: 10/10 
The site does a great job at providing images for everything that is interactable. It makes it easy to recognize what can be interacted with and what purpose everything serves, such as the play and replay buttons. 

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: 8/10
The site has a shortcut where after entering a new page, you can see from what page you left off from. This takes away the need to use a back button. 

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: 10/10 
The layout is fantastic. The design is very basic but only provides useful information and images to help navigate. 

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: 5/10
There isn’t any room for error and therefore there is no need for recovery. 

10. Help and documentation: 10/10 
The site provides helpful labels and short sentences to help the user navigate to whatever section they are looking for. Simple and effective.


<!-- MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE FINDINGS SECTION YOU CAN EXPAND UPON THIS
  Youtube ranked rather high due to its variability in content and accessibility behind the product. However, this also brings the issue of little regulation on quality which could teach users incorrectly and its lack of skill assessment and skill tracking. It is a Free option and accessible on nearly all Internet-enabled devices.<br><br>
	DrillRoom, an IOS app is strong in its ability to train separate skills while being very active and leveraging the use of AI. Although, AI’s can be confidently wrong and the app follows a subscription model and requires a tripod and lighting to work. It should be noted that the expanded version was not tested due to our limited budget. For that reason Drill room, despite its rather high quality drills, is not as accessible or easy to use as other products.<br><br>
  Basic Billiards follows a free model with a website that is easy to jump into with selectable courses from the basics of how to hold a pool stick to the higher level strategy. While there is no interactivity, the articles are concise and most often have a video or animation to assist in making the point. The articles themselves are rather good quality, but there is no way to ensure the user has mastered the skill or is doing the drill correctly. It also is available on all internet-enabled devices.<br><br>
  The Physical training aid was not tested due to our limited budget. Regardless, we identified strengths and weaknesses to the best of our ability. The devices can be used without internet access and can help alleviate table specific issues. For Instance, bad bumpers, unlevel tables, chipped or dented balls. The downsides to the physical training aids is they are expensive with the cheaper ones going from 15$ upwards to 100$ per training aid, and you will need more than one in order to effectively train a vast skill set.<br>

## Conclusions

After collecting data on our competitors, it became clear that interactivity is a struggle for most options. For Youtube and BasicBilliards both options were free and provided great information, but lacked any type of interactivity and skill tracking. The physical trainer and DrillRoom provided interactivity but both cost money. They also require the user to invest much more time and effort to learn. Our project should aim to add at least some form of interactivity while staying affordable. It should also stay simple to use for the convenience of users. 


## Caveats
We did not take actual feedback from users so we made assumptions about who our users might and thus we could not do any testing.
<br/>
We are a novice UX team comprised of students, so the inability to dedicate a substantial amount of time and experience limits the teams ability.
<br>
We also have little to no funding, making it difficult to test products.
